# Data Structures & Algorithms II Coursework

Notes, exercises, and more from DSAII

My coursework from DSAII involves basic graphics programming in C++. Utilizing OpenGL, I have been exposed to the graphics programming pipeline and implemented topics such as OpenGL callback functions, double buffering, draw methods including retained mode and vertex buffer objects, and 3D camera and projections.
